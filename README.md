# Frontend nanodegree arcade game
This is a simple HTML5 canvas based game developed for the Udacity front end nanodegree program. Game engine, resources loading and graphics were provided by Udacity. I implemented rendering of all objects as well as game logic.

## Playing instructions
Use arrow keys to move the character on the board. Collect gems to earn points. Touching a bug or stepping on a water tile results in the loss of one life. New lives can be earned by collecting occasionally appearing hearts from the board. Game ends if time or player's lives run off.
